# Introduction

The **Rezolve SDK** is a software development kit that enables the app developer to integrate Rezolve's unique abilities within their app. 

## Capabilities

The Rezolve SDK is a full-featured application suite. Capabilities that can be integrated into your application include:

* Consumer account creation and Rezolve login
* Consumer profile and wallet management
* Consumer management of topup devices
* Scanning of Rezolve Encoded visual media
* Listening to Rezolve Encoded audio media
* Purchasing of scanned products
* Purchasing of topups
* Purchase history

## Intended audience

This document is intended for experienced IOS and Android developer. It is expected that you have built apps before, and know your way around an IDE.

## For more information

For more information on Rezolve, see http://rezolve.com.

# Getting Started

## Get an API key

Using the Rezolve API requires a contract. Please visit <a href="https://www.rezolve.com/#sectionForm">our contact form</a> and supply your info. We will respond ASAP, and provied an API key upon contract completion.

## Download the SDK

The Rezolve SDK for **IOS** can be downloaded here: <a href="#">TBD</a>

The Rezolve SDK for **Android** can be downloaded here: <a href="#">TBD</a>

## Set up the SDK - IOS

**XCode** is the target IDE for these instructions.

The IOS SDK is distributed as a .framework. This makes it easy to embed Rezolve capabilities in your app. The steps are as follows:

1. Open your existing project.<br/><br/>
2. Go to the app targetâ€™s General configuration page.<br/><br/>
3. Add the framework target to the Embedded Binaries section by clicking the Add icon, and picking the framework file you downloaded. Do not drag in the framework from Finder. <br/><img src="images/add-framework.png" style="margin:6px 0; border:1px solid #333;"><br/><br/>
4. Select your framework from the list of binaries that can be embedded.

TODO: verify instructions with Marcos
TODO: do we need to import anythinng per file, or otherwise set up the framework in code to use it? Marcos

## Set up the SDK - Android

**Android Studio** is the target IDE for these instructions.

The Android SDK is distributed as an .aar library. This makes it easy to import Rezolve capabilities into your app. The steps are as follows:

1. For this demo, the project **test.example.com** has been created.<br/><br/>
2. In your project, go to File > New Module... <br/><img src="images/02newmodule.png" style="margin:6px 0;"><br/><br/>
3. ... and choose Import JAR/.AAR Package. Hit Next. <br/><img src="images/03importaar.png" style="margin:6px 0;"><br/><br/>
4. Select the SDK file you downloaded, and click Finish. File name may differ from what is shown in screenshot. <br/><img src="images/04pickaar.png" style="margin:6px 0;"><br/><br/>
5. The SDK should import as a module. You are now ready to develop. <br/><img src="images/05imported.png" style="margin:6px 0;"><br/><br/>

# SDK Feature Use

This section describes the intended usage of the SDK to build specific feature-related functionalities.

## Basic Usage

``` objective_c
import RezolveSDK

...

let API_KEY: String = "ABC123"           //substitute your api key here
let sdk: RezolveSDK = RezolveSDK(apiKey: API_KEY, env: .Development)

// possible values for env: enum are .Development , .Sandbox, and .Production
```
```java
import com.rezolve.sdk.RezolveSDK;

...

private final static String API_KEY = "ABC123";

RezolveSDK sdk = RezolveSDK.getInstance(API_KEY, RezolveSDK.Env.DEVELOPMENT);

// possible values for RezolveSDK.Env enum are .DEVELOPMENT , .SANDBOX, and .PRODUCTION
```

To get started, import the SDK into your file, and initialize it. When initializing the SDK in your page, you must specify your `API Key`, and the `server environment` you are targeting. 

Your `API Key` is supplied to you upon signup with Rezolve.

Your `server environment` is an enum. See values, right.

TODO Marcos verify

TODO Adam verify


##  User Management, Session Management

For the purpose of the SDK, it is assumed the partner has an existing community of consumers, and has a method of authenticating them in the partner app. It is further assumed the partner wishes to introduce their consumes to Rezolve capabilities. Each partner consumer that wishes to utilize Rezolve services will need a Rezolve account.

This section will describe how to:

1. Register a Rezolve user via the SDK
2. Create a Session for that user
3. When the user is done, log them out

<img src="images/loginsequencediagram.png" style="margin:6px 0;"><br/>[ <a href="images/loginsequencediagram.png">View full size</a> ]

### Register User

```objective_c
let request: AuthenticationRequest = authenticationRequest()
// TODO populate authenticationRequest object

let sdk: RezolveSDK = RezolveSDK(apiKey: API_KEY, env: .Development)

sdk.registerUser(authenticationRequest: request) {  (entityId, partnerId) in 
	// persist the entity_id and partner_id values here
}
```
```java
private final static String API_KEY = "ABC123";

RezolveSDK sdk = RezolveSDK.getInstance(API_KEY, RezolveSDK.Env.DEVELOPMENT);

AuthenticationRequest myAuthenticationRequest = new AuthenticationRequest.Builder()
.email("b")
.firstName("d")
.lastName("e")
.name("h")
.device(new DeviceProfile("12345", "Samsung", "UK"))
.build();

sdk.registerUser(myAuthenticationRequest, this);

//TODO catch response
```
To register a user, you will need to call the sdk `registerUser` method, passing in an `authenticationRequest` object. The authenticationRequest object is defined as shown to the right. It is composed of a deviceProfile object, and four user data fields. All fields are strings.

The `registerUser` method is used as shown to the right. Upon successful registration, the response will contain a `partner_id` and an `entity_id`. **Persist both these values for the life of the app.**

<aside class="notice">
You will know if you need to call `registerUser` instead of `createSession` if either `partner_id` or `entity_id` are null or blank.
</aside>

<aside class="alert">
It is recommended that <code>entity_id</code> and <code>partner_id</code> be persisted to the partner server. If these values are stored server side, a consumer who uninstalls the app and reinstalls will be able to retain their history and settings. Without this info, their account cannot be reassociated after install.
</aside>


### Create Session

``` objective_c
let request: AuthenticationRequest = authenticationRequest()
// TODO populate authenticationRequest object

let sdk: RezolveSDK = RezolveSDK(apiKey: API_KEY, env: .Development)

sdk.createSession(authenticationRequest: request) { (session: RezolveSession) in
	// begin interacting with features
}
```
```java
private final static String API_KEY = "ABC123";
private RezolveSession rezolveSession;

RezolveSDK sdk = RezolveSDK.getInstance(API_KEY, RezolveSDK.Env.DEVELOPMENT);
```
To log in and interact with Rezolve services, you must establish a session. A session combines several functions, and abstracts them from the developer:
* Verifies the validity of the mobile app, through the API key
* Identifies the consumer and pairs them with a session token
* Verifies each request from the mobile app by passing API Key and session token
* establishes a public key for the session, for encrypting transmitted credit card info

Once the user is authenticated on the partner side, make a call to `createSession{}`, passing in the `entity_id`. The server will respond with a session authentication token, and a session public key. The SDK takes care of managing these for the session. The auth token is used to authenticate each request from the client, while the public key is used for encrypting the transmission of sensitive information for this session.

### Logout Session

``` objective_c
TODO add code sample, IOS
```
```java
TODO add code sample, Android
```
Logging a user out is as simple as passing the `entity_id` to the logout method.

## Consumer Profile Management

Once logged in, you have access to the consumer's records. These include:
* Consumer Profile - Name, email, and device profile (phone info) for the consumer
* Address Book - A collection of postal addresses, to be used for ship-to and bill-to purposes.
* Favorites - A collection of devices that can be topped up.  A favorite can represent a mobile phone, a tollway transponder, or other device/account.
* Wallet - Wallet lets you store credit card info securely, and lets the consumer maintain the list of cards. There can be multiple cards.

There are no specific flows to consider when managing the customer profile and assicated records. The consumer profile itself supports only update... no add or delete. 

Address Book, Favorites, and Wallet all support standard CRUD operations. 

## Instant buy flow

<img src="images/Instant%20Purchase%20flow.png" style="margin:6px 0;"><br/>[ <a href="images/Instant%20Purchase%20flow.png">View full size</a> ]

The premise of instant purchase is to capture an image scan (usually of an advertisement) with the smartphone, resolve it into a product URL, fetch the product info, and enable purchase via saved account information.

First, enable the scan screen, and capture a watermarked image. The Digimarc SDK will extract a Digimarc id from the image. Use the Digimarc SDK to fetch the "payoff" URL associated with the id from the Digimarc server. This url will point to a getProduct API endpoint.

Use the SDK `getProduct` call to retrieve product information. The `partner_id`, `merchant_id`, `catalog_id` and `product_id` will be in the URL received from Digimarc; the body of the request can be empty.  The response will include the title, price, description, variant choices, and images for the product.

Once you have product information, call the SDK `checkoutOrder` method. Pass in the merchant, type, delivery address id, loyalty info (if any), geolocation if available, and finally the information on the desired product, including variant choices.  The response will include an order id, final total price, and a price breakdown (composed of base price, variant price premium if any, shipping, and tax). 

If the consumer agrees with the price and wishes to complete the order, use `walletService.getAll` to list the available card choices. The consumer will choose a payment card.

At this point, we recommend using a "slide to buy" button to confirm purchase intent, while preserving the maximum ease of use.

When the user confirms intent, pass the card choice and the entered CVV value to the `buyOrder` method. The response will contain either an order confirmation with receipt info, or if rejected, an error with the reason for the order rejection.

## Top Up flow

<img src="images/Topup%20Flow.png" style="margin:6px 0;"><br/>[ <a href="images/Topup%20Flow.png">View full size</a> ]

The top up flow gives the mobile consumer the ability to add money to a remote account that is linked with a specific device, such as a mobile phone or tollway transponder. The consumer must have first added the topup device (called a Favorite) to their account, using the `favouriteService.create` method. Once there is one or more favorites, use the `favouriteService.getAll` method to list them. The customer will choose a favorite.

The customer then wants to see a list of top up amounts. To accomplish this, we use the `getProducts` method, passing in a fixed category id. Note that each top up amount is stored in the catalog as a separate product with it's own SKU.

Display the list of top up choices. You can display each "product" as a currency amount, or utilize the "description" field of the product to give more information about the topup. It depends on your application. The consumer will choose a top up amount.

When you have the product choice, call the SDK `checkoutOrder` method. Pass in the merchant, type, delivery address id, loyalty info (if any), geolocation if available, and finally the information on the chosen product.  The response will include an order id, final total price, and a price breakdown (composed of base price, shipping, and tax).

If the consumer agrees with the price and wishes to complete the order, use `walletService.getAll` to list the available card choices. The consumer will choose a payment card.

At this point, we recommend using a "slide to buy" button to confirm purchase intent, while preserving the maximum ease of use.

When the user confirms intent, pass the card choice and the entered CVV value to the `buyOrder` method. The response will contain either an order confirmation with receipt info, or if rejected, an error with the reason for the order rejection.
