# Kitten API Examples

> To authorize, use this code:

``` objective_c
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```java
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```


> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
